 1: We are going to implement acceleration, velocity, braking, slowing down, changing the angle of the car, and determining
    horizontal and vertical displacement of this car based on its angle.
    (1): Loading images
    (2): Creating the Pygame window
    (3): Display images
    (4): Resizing images
    (5): Rotating the car
    (6): Key presses and turning
    (7): Acceleration and velocity
    (8): Moving the car by an angle
    (9): Slowing down the car

2: Pixel Perfect Collision
    (1): Moving the car backwards
    (2): Mask: mask is an array of values, representing whether or not a pixel in an image is transparent or present.
            With mask, we can simply check if pixels that are not transparent or overlapping in two rectangle regions.
    (3): Collision with the Track
    (4): Handel the hitting with the wall --> bounce
    (5): Adding the finish line
    (6): Collision with the finish line


3: Computer Car And Path Following
    (1): Create the computer car
    (2): Create a Path
    (3): Path following explanation --> Moving the computer car towards these points.
    (4): Computer Collision with finish line


4: Levels, Main Menu and Finishing Touches
    (1): Create the game info class
    (2): Drawing text
    (3): Starting levels / main menu
    (4): Level stats and info text
    (5): Increasing computer car's speed
    (6): Handling winning the game
